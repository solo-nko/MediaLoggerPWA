# Media Tracker

## Overview

This is an application being developed to gain a better understanding of progressive web app development, component libraries, and indexedDB. I'm also making it because I've tried using OneNote and Excel to track my current media (what I'm currently playing, watching, reading etc.) and found it somewhat less than ideal. So, I'm attempting to make my own solution.

## Features

As this is a progressive app, it is installable to use locally! It uses a client-side database for its data storage.

## How to Use
